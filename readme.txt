 * URL Shortner - Bluefin Enterprises - Coding Challenge
**/

1- This coding challenge was developed and tested using APACHE (MAMP). Please redirect APACHE document directory to use url_shortner folder.

2- In myphpadmin, create a database called url_shortner_ricardo and use the file url_shortner_ricardo.sql (included in url_shortner folder) to create and fill the tables.

3- Update the file url_shortner/_admin/config.php with your HOST (current is localhost:8889), database USER and PASSWORD (current is root and root).

4- There are 3 buttons in the nav area: Home, List and Report. The Home menu is the first page where you create the short url (or get the short url if it already exist). The List option will show all URL and Short URL that are in the database. The Report shows the number of times, the country and city where it was visited. It can also show the number of visits in a certain period.

5- When using a local server (APACHE) the country and city will be recorded as Unknown.
